The manufacturing of teaching material conveys the generation
of both static (unreactive) data-documents 
and dynamic (reactive) program-documents
based on different technologies.
Teaching a subject often implies the maintenance
of a large number of both types of 
documents, usually written in a variety of languages
and stored in different formats.
Ergo a natural goal for the lecturer is to minimize the amount of work invested 
during the development and maintenance of the material.
There are acceptable 
solutions regarding the transformation between 
formats with the same kind of reactivity. 
This work discusses the problem of integrating Moodle 
(a Open Source Learning Management System)
and LaTeX (a  Document Preparation System),
proposes a methodology to pursuit this goal and presents a tool to assist 
in the translation of Moodle Quiz documents to LaTeX.
