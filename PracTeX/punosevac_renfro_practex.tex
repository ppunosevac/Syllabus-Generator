\abstract{
A life at the typical U.S. department present-days involves
large number of contingent faculty who are assigned to teach significant
number of service courses possibly even a two-three days before the
start of the term. Instead on relaying on them to write their Syllabi I
would prefer to have those generated by person in charge for teaching
with as little input from other humans as possible. In this article we
describe a design of an Automatics Syllabus Generator.
